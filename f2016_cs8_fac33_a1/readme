this small program is helping you to determin whether you need to throw your car into garbage or keep it with the data of mpg and
 liter/100 KM.

 First, it will ask you to type in which system you want to use. please look at the instruction inside the program. DO NOT type in any
 other wierd things into program which might cause the program crash.

 The answer will print out like this:

 A=['                    ', 'USC', '               ', 'Metric']
A1=['Distance-------:', '44862835.712 miles', '  ', '27876543.000 Km']
A2=['Gas------------:', '885.786 gallons', '    ', '234.000 liters']
A3=['Consumption----:', '50647.491 gpm', '    ', '0.001 1/100Km']
Gas Consumption Rating :  Excellent


which you need to see it as a form.
